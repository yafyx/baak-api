# 403 Forbidden Errors in BAAK API

## The Problem

BAAK's website throws up barriers to stop scrapers:

1. Rate limiting based on IP
2. Sniffing out bot user-agents
3. Fingerprinting your browser
4. Cookie/session checks
5. Looking for suspicious request patterns

I've built some workarounds to get past these roadblocks.

## What I've Already Built In

My API comes loaded with these anti-403 tricks:

1. **Real Browser Headers**: Every request looks legit
2. **Random User-Agents**: Switches between common browsers to stay under the radar
3. **Session Handling**: Keeps cookies consistent like a real user
4. **Smart Retries**: Backs off exponentially when hitting resistance
5. **Realistic Referrers**: Makes it look like normal browsing
6. **Human-like Timing**: Adds random delays between requests
